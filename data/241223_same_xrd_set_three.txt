This article is one of at least 6 articles with at least one common co-author that all use the same XRD pattern to describe environmental dust, most of which have identical peak labels. These articles are:

1. [Dust mitigation from inclined hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces under electrostatic repulsion](https://pubpeer.com/publications/626C661BA2544CB7957FCE7AEA7660), *Journal of Electrostatics*, Figure 3C
2. [A novel method for dust mitigation from PV cell surfaces](https://pubpeer.com/publications/17352F76EF0DDBD95300AC0ABB4822), *Solar Energy*, Figure 4C
3. [Avalanche effect for chemically modified dust mitigation from surfaces](https://pubpeer.com/publications/C76259FA3DB1218479DFDAF7D1A28A), *Scientific Reports*. Figure 3

Here is the version presented in Figure X of this article. 



Most of the labeled peaks in this XRD pattern are likely not attributable to the mineral with which they are labeled. 

Below, I compare the version of this plot shown in Figure 3 of the [third article on the list above](https://pubpeer.com/publications/C76259FA3DB1218479DFDAF7D1A28A) to the expected peaks for these minerals (for minerals in this list with a corresponding XRD pattern in the [RRUFF database](https://rruff.info/)). These images can be reproduced with the code [here](https://github.com/reeserich/compare_xrd).

Could the authors provide the raw data for this pattern and clarify how they labeled peaks as attributable to specific minerals?
