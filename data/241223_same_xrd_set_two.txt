This article is one of at least 3 articles with at least one common co-author that all use the same XRD pattern to describe environmental dust, most of which have identical peak labels. These articles are:

1. [Stretchable Hydrophobic Surfaces and Self-Cleaning Applications](https://pubpeer.com/publications/1CEB5F482CE0285D81311C40454AA3), *Scientific Reports*, Figure 4
2. [Self-cleaning of a hydrophobic surface by a rolling water droplet](https://pubpeer.com/publications/27E7F7FD39AD9E9326756A97ABF44D), *Scientific Reports*, Figure 2
3. [Chemo-Mechanical Characteristics of Mud Formed from Environmental Dust Particles in Humid Ambient Air](https://pubpeer.com/publications/58A042B5671055EDCEDC3E73C6D13F), *Scientific Reports*, Figure 3

Here is the version presented in Figure X of this article. 



This plot has many issues.

1. "Quarz" should read "Quartz".
2. "Arhdride" should read "Anhydrite".
3. "Dolamid" should read "Dolomite".
4. Most of the labeled peaks in this XRD pattern likely not attributable to the mineral with which they are labeled. 

Below, I compare the version of this plot shown in Figure 3 of the [third article on the list above](https://pubpeer.com/publications/58A042B5671055EDCEDC3E73C6D13F) to the expected peaks for these minerals (for minerals in this list with a corresponding XRD pattern in the [RRUFF database](https://rruff.info/)). These images can be reproduced with the code [here](https://github.com/reeserich/compare_xrd).

Could the authors provide the raw data for this pattern and clarify how they labeled peaks as attributable to specific minerals?
