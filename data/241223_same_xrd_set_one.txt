Here is the version presented in Figure X of this article.

This plot has many issues.

1. "Quarz" should read "Quartz".
2. "Arhdride" should read "Anhydrite".
3. There are no peaks labeled as belonging to FeO (black star).
4. Most of the labeled peaks in this XRD pattern likely not attributable to the mineral with which they are labeled. 

Below, I compare the version of this plot shown in Figure 2 of the [first article on the list above](https://pubpeer.com/publications/CC446BE21C681295489BCC2FC63590) to the expected peaks for these minerals (for minerals in this list with a corresponding XRD pattern in the [RRUFF database](https://rruff.info/)). These images can be reproduced with the code [here](https://github.com/reeserich/compare_xrd).

Could the authors provide the raw data for this pattern and clarify how they labeled peaks as attributable to specific minerals?
